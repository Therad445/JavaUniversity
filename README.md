## Overview
The project models a university education system, including classes for students, courses, professors, and enrollment processes. It provides a basic framework for managing the relationships and interactions between these entities.
## Features
- **Student Management**: Create and manage student records.- **Course Management**: Define courses and manage course offerings.- **Enrollment**: Enroll students in courses and track their progress.- **Professor Management**: Assign professors to courses and manage their schedules.
## Project Structure
- **Main.java**: The main entry point of the application, handling user interaction and overall program flow.- **Student.java**: Class representing a student, with attributes like name, ID, and list of enrolled courses.- **Course.java**: Class representing a course, including course name, code, and list of enrolled students.- **Professor.java**: Class representing a professor, responsible for teaching courses.- **University.java**: Class that ties together students, courses, and professors, managing the overall system.
